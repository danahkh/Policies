# Privacy Policy for Doc Expiry Tracker

_Last updated: January 21, 2026_

Doc Expiry Tracker ("the app") is designed to help you keep track of your document expiry dates. We take your privacy seriously and keep the app as simple and private as possible.

## 1. No account, no registration

- The app does **not** require you to create an account.
- We do **not** ask you to sign in with email, phone number, or social accounts.

## 2. Data we collect

- We **do not collect, store, or transmit** any personal data from your device to our own servers.
- Document details you enter (such as names, dates, notes, and categories) are stored **only on your device** as part of the app’s normal operation.
- We do not track your identity, location, or contacts.

## 3. Third‑party services and ads

The app may display third‑party advertisements in order to keep the app free.

- While **we** do not collect your personal information, third‑party ad providers may collect certain information (for example, device identifiers or usage data) in order to show relevant ads.
- Any data collected by these third‑party services is handled under **their own privacy policies**, not ours.

We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of the ad networks used in the app for more detail on what they collect and how they use it.

## 4. Analytics and tracking

- We do **not** use our own analytics systems to track your behavior inside the app.
- We do **not** use our own cookies or tracking technologies.

Any tracking done by third‑party ad networks is subject to their policies.

## 5. Children’s privacy

Doc Expiry Tracker is intended for general use. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

Because we do not collect data on our own servers and do not manage user accounts, we have no way to identify or delete individual user records.

## 6. Data retention and deletion

- All document data you enter is stored **locally on your device**.
- Uninstalling the app from your device will remove the locally stored data.

If your device is backed up (for example, by your operating system), those backups are controlled by your device provider, not by us.

## 7. Security

Because your document data is stored only on your device, its security depends on your device’s security (such as screen lock, encryption, and backup settings).

We do not have access to your personal data and therefore cannot view or edit it.

## 8. Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in this document, and the "Last updated" date at the top will be revised.

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

## 9. Contact

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or how the app works, please contact us via the contact details provided in the app store listing.
